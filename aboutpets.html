<h2><font color="green">All about our Pets</font></h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>People who have pets are lucky. Every day seems fun and interesting when they are around. A pet is an animal that lives with people but is not forced to work. Many people prefer dogs and cats as their pets. Taking care of pets is both fun and hard, and once you start doing it, it's hard to stop.</p>

<h2><font color="orange">Pet Dogs</font></h2>
<p>A dog is a domestic mammal of the family Canidae and the order Carnivora. Its scientific name is Canis lupus familiaris. Dogs are a subspecies of the gray wolf, and they are also related to foxes and jackals. Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world.</p>
<h3>Our Pet Dogs</h3>
<h4><font color="blue">1.Golden Retriever</font></h4>
<p>The golden retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S.—for good reason. They are simultaneously wonderful family pets—thanks to their friendly, tolerant attitude—and capable, intelligent working dogs. These sturdy, medium-sized dogs grow to about 55–75 pounds and typically live to be about 10–12 years old. Outgoing, trustworthy, eager-to-please, and easy-to-train, they are especially popular with families with young children. Goldens often maintain their fun-loving puppy attitudes and signature smile into adulthood.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">2.German Shepered</font></h4>
<p>
    They are the second most popular dog breed in the United States.
    They are often used as working dogs in a variety of roles, including police dogs, search and rescue dogs, and service dogs.
    This breed has appeared in many movies and television shows, including “Rin Tin Tin,” “Lassie,” and “Max.”
    The most famous German Shepherd is probably Strongheart, who starred in over 20 silent films in the early 1920s.
    German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males, and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females.
    They can reach sprinting speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.
    German Shepherd puppies are born with closed eyes and folded ears. They start to open their eyes at around 10-14 days old, and their ears start to perk up at around 3-4 weeks old. They are very playful and energetic. They need plenty of exercise and stimulation to stay happy and healthy.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">3.Poodle</font></h4>
<p>Poodles have been in existence for many centuries and historical reference to them has been found in Germany, England, Italy and France. In pictorial evidence the dogs nearly always appear in the traditional lion clip, which leaves the hindquarters bare except for leg bands and a pom-pom on the tail, while the forequarters are heavily coated except for the face and legs. This appears to indicate that these dogs were used for sporting and retrieving purposes. As the coat is quite heavy when wet, they were clipped in areas to alleviate weight. The tail was docked as a long tail would be caught in the undergrowth. The ribbon on the topknot was to indicate that the dog was working and also to signify it was not a bird or other animal.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">4.Bulldog</font></h4>
<p>You can't mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed brow, pushed-in nose, small ears, undershot jaw with hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait all practically scream 'I'm a Bulldog!' The coat, seen in a variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to 50 pounds, but that won't stop them from curling up in your lap, or at least trying to. But don't mistake their easygoing ways for laziness'¿Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are best spent in an air-conditioned room as a Bulldog's short snout can cause labored breathing in hot and humid weather.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">5.German Shorthaired Pointer</font></h4>
<p>The versatile, medium-sized German Shorthaired Pointer is an enthusiastic gundog of all trades who thrives on vigorous exercise, positive training, and a lot of love. GSP people call their aristocratic companions the 'perfect pointer.' Male German Shorthaired Pointers stand between 23 and 25 inches at the shoulder and weigh anywhere from 55 to 70 pounds; females run smaller. The coat is solid liver (a reddish brown), or liver and white in distinctive patterns. The dark eyes shine with enthusiasm and friendliness. Built to work long days in the field or at the lake, GSPs are known for power, speed, agility, and endurance. 'Noble' and 'aristocratic' are words often used to describe the overall look. GSPs make happy, trainable pets who bond firmly to their family. They are always up for physical activities like running, swimming, organized dog sports'¿in fact, anything that will burn some of their boundless energy while spending outdoors time with a human buddy.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">6.Pembroke Welsh Corgi</font></h4>
<p>Among the most agreeable of all small housedogs, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a strong, athletic, and lively little herder who is affectionate and companionable without being needy. They are one the world's most popular herding breeds. At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day's work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings. The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training. As herders bred to move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute senses and a 'big dog' bark. Families who can meet their bold but kindly Pembroke's need for activity and togetherness will never have a more loyal, loving pet.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">7.Australian Shepherd</font></h4>
<p>The Australian Shepherd, a lean, tough ranch dog, is one of those 'only in America' stories: a European breed perfected in California by way of Australia. Fixtures on the rodeo circuit, they are closely associated with the cowboy life. The Australian Shepherd, the cowboy's herding dog of choice, is a medium-sized worker with a keen, penetrating gaze in the eye. Aussie coats offer different looks, including merle (a mottled pattern with contrasting shades of blue or red). In all ways, they're the picture of rugged and agile movers of stock. Aussies exhibit an irresistible impulse to herd, anything: birds, dogs, kids. This strong work drive can make Aussies too much dog for a sedentary pet owner. Aussies are remarkably intelligent, quite capable of hoodwinking an unsuspecting novice owner. In short, this isn't the pet for everyone. But if you're looking for a brainy, tireless, and trainable partner for work or sport, your search might end here.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">8.Yorkshire Terrier</font></h4>
<p>Beneath the dainty, glossy, floor-length coat of a Yorkshire Terrier beats the heart of a feisty, old-time terrier. Yorkies earned their living as ratters in mines and mills long before they became the beribboned lapdogs of Victorian ladies. The Yorkshire Terrier is a compact, toy-size terrier of no more than seven pounds whose crowning glory is a floor-length, silky coat of steel blue and a rich golden tan. Don't let the Yorkie's daintiness fool you. Tenacious, feisty, brave, and sometimes bossy, the Yorkie exhibits all the traits of a true terrier. Often named the most popular dog breed in various American cities, Yorkies pack lots of big-town attitude into a small but self-important package. They are favorites of urbanites the world over. Yorkies are long-lived and hypoallergenic (the coat is more like human hair than animal fur), and they make fine little watchdogs. This is a true 'personality breed,' providing years of laughs, love, and close companionship.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">9.Cane Carso</font></h4>
<p>Smart, trainable, and of noble bearing, the assertive and confident Cane Corso is a peerless protector. The Corso's lineage goes back to ancient Roman times, and the breed's name roughly translates from the Latin as 'bodyguard dog.'
At nearly 28 inches at the shoulder and often weighing more than 100 pounds, with a large head, alert expression, and muscles rippling beneath their short, stiff coat, Corsi are at a glance intimidating creatures. Their imposing appearance is their first line of defense against intruders. As one writer put it, 'An understated air of cool competence, the kind of demeanor you'd expect from a professional bodyguard, is the breed's trademark.'     Corsi are intelligent, loyal, eager to please, versatile, and intensely loyal to their humans, but are also assertive and willful, and can end up owning an unwitting owner. As with any other big guardian dog, responsible breeding and early socialization with people and other dogs is vital.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">10.Shih Tzu</font></h4>
<p>The Shih Tzu personality is enormously appealing, and even grudging dog observers find it hard to resist this breed. The Shih Tzu simply doesn’t allow anyone to ignore them. The were bred to be a friendly companion–they don’t hunt, herd, or guard–and that’s what they are. They love nothing more than to meet and greet friends and strangers alike. Count on a Shih Tzu to make friends wherever they go.
Not only is this member of the Toy Group good-natured and friendly, they’re highly adaptable. They’re as well suited to apartments in the city as to life on a country farm. They love children and get along with other animals. However, although the Shih Tzu is a sturdy dog, their small size puts them at a disadvantage. Adults should always supervise interactions between children and dogs, and this is especially important for the Shih Tzu, to prevent them from accidentally getting hurt during rough play.</p>

<h2><font color="orange">Pet Cats</font></h2>
<p>Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>
<h3>Our Pet Cats</h3>
<h4><font color="blue">1.Russian Blue Cat</font></h4>
<p>With her triangular-shaped head, the Russian blue is a long and slender cat. She is fine-boned with large ears, a broad forehead and straight nose, making her a very regal animal. Russian blues are known for a natural "smile." In addition to her luxurious silvery coat, her most distinct features are her brilliant green eyes.
Despite being slender, the Russian blue is very strong and muscular, although her thick fur often hides her neck and shoulders, giving the impression that her frame is more robust. Her long legs allow her to run at high speeds.</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">2. Burmese Cat</font></h4>
<p>The Burmese is a cat that is round all over. The head is round, the tips of the ears are round, the eyes, chin and even the feet are round. This breed is solid both in looks and in feel and has great strength.
The coat of the Burmese is short and glossy. Darker shading on the points may be seen in kittens, but this shading disappears with age, producing richness in any of the accepted colors.
While the accepted colors for Burmese have increased in the past few years, the vast majority of Burmese are still the traditional deep brown (sable)..</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">3.Bengal Cat</font></h4>
<p>The first time you see a Bengal cat roaming through your house, you might think a jungle cat has broken in. That's because this spectacular breed sports a spotted or marbled coat that looks a lot like a wild leopard or ocelot. But the Bengal is anything but wild, and has a loving, affectionate personality. While Bengals were developed by breeding domestic felines to an Asian leopard cat, their wild natures have long been abandoned. </p> 
<h4><font color="blue">4.Persian Cat</font></h4>
<p> There's no mistaking a Persian cat when you see one. These iconic felines are well-known for their thick fur coats, large eyes, and stocky bodies. But there's one characteristic that immediately comes to mind when you think about a Persian's appearance: Their cute, smooshy faces.
These cats are a medium-sized breed, with female Persians weighing between 7-10 pounds and males at a slightly larger 9-13 pounds. That long, lustrous Persian coat comes in a host of colors, including orange, gray, and cream, and their eyes are typically a brilliant copper, green, hazel, or blue. </p> 
<h4><font color="blue">5.Siamese Cat</font></h4>
<p>The Siamese cat's personality is friendly, affectionate, outgoing, and social. This beautiful breed is also one of the most intelligent around. The Siamese is loving and trusting with humans, and he thrives with lots of positive human interaction. He's also deeply sensitive and will take any harsh words to heart. As with any pet, use positive reinforcement when training him to use the litter box or teaching him your couch is not a scratching toy. </p> 
<h4><font color="blue">6.Sphynx Cat</font></h4>
<p>The most obvious feature of this striking cat is their lack of a fur coat; however, Sphynx cats vary in the degree of hairlessness, with some having a very fine ‘peach fuzz’ all over and others just a fine fuzz over the extremities. Due to the lack of fur, the Sphynx cats bone structure and musculature is there for all to see, and this is a remarkably robust cat, built on elegant long lines, with somewhat loose skin that forms wrinkles in some places. </p> 
<h4><font color="blue">7.Scottish Fold Cat</font></h4>
<p>The Scottish Fold’s ancestry lies with farm cats, and as you may imagine, a Scottish farm cat needed to be a rugged and hardy animal. Although the show example has come a long way since those days, this is still a robust, tough natured cat. They are easily adaptable to most situations, not worried about loud or busy homes but equally at home in a quiet, single person’s abode. They are said to have a sweet disposition and a tiny voice which is used very rarely. </p> 
<h4><font color="blue">8.British Shorthair Cat</font></h4>
<p>The British shorthair cat is a medium-to-large-sized cat breed with a short, dense coat and a distinctive rounded head and face that make it look a lot like a cuddly teddy bear. The British shorthair cat is sweet and affectionate without being needy or clingy. This breed hails from the United Kingdom where it developed naturally and was the region’s original domestic shorthaired cat. Originally, many British shorthairs were blue colored (a gray hue), but today’s British shorthair comes in a veritable rainbow of colors and patterns, including solid, bicolor, tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, and more.  </p> 
<h4><font color="blue">9.Maine Coon Cat</font></h4>
<p> Maine coons are large, affectionate cats who love to play and hang out with their humans. This cat breed is typically known for its massive size—up to 40 inches in length—but Maine coon owners know and prize these cats for being loving family pets.
 Maine coons are surprisingly popular, especially considering at one point this breed almost faced extinction. In 2019, the Cat Fanciers' Association listed the Maine coon as the fifth-most popular cat breed. The average Maine coon kitten costs between $400 and $1,500, depending on pedigree</p> 
<h4><font color="blue">10.Ragdoll Cat</font></h4>
<p>The Ragdoll is a large, impressive and luxuriantly coated cat breed. Underneath an impressive silky, dense, and semi-long to long haired coat, there is a long, muscular cat with a broad chest, short neck, and sturdy legs. The tail is long and bushy, and the coat will, in the adult cat, form fluffy trousers on the hind-legs and a majestic ruff around the neck and throat.   </p>

<p>Small pet birds like finches, canaries, parakeets, and lovebirds are friendly low maintenance birds. They are also the best kinds of pet birds for beginners and apartments. Larger pet parrots, cockatiels, and cockatoos also make great household pet birds but take more care and attention.</p>
<h3>Our Pet Birds</h3>
