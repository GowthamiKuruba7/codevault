<h4><font color="green">About pet Dogs</font></h4>
<p>A dog is a domestic mammal of the family Canidae and the order Carnivora. Its scientific name is Canis lupus familiaris. Dogs are a subspecies of the gray wolf, and they are also related to foxes and jackals. Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world.</p>
<h4><font color="green">About pet Dogs caring and maintenance</font></h4>
<p>Proper pet care includes providing a safe, cozy shelter
    It is also a good idea to register your pet with Finding Rover. Always provide shade and shelter, along with water. Indoors, dogs also typically enjoy having their own dog bed and older dogs, in particular, may benefit from having an orthopedic bed.</p>
<h4><font color="pink">About pet Cats</font></h4>
<p>Rabbits are social creatures and are happiest in the company of their own species. The best combination is a neutered male and neutered female. They can become extremely sad and depressed if kept on their own.</p>
<h4><font color="pink">About pet Cats caring and maintenance</font></h4>    
<p>Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine. You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat's water bowls daily.</p>

<h4><font color="blue">About pet Rabbits</font></h4>
<p>Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>
<h4><font color="blue">About pet Rabbits caring and maintenance</font></h4>    
<p>Rabbits make great pets, but like other small pets, they need lots of care and attention. You'll need to make sure you have plenty of time to spend with them every day. Rabbits with long fur also take much more looking after as their fur can become matted quickly and they need grooming every day.</p>
<h4><font color="grey">About pet Birds</font></h4>
<p>Parakeets are perhaps the most popular type of pet bird the world over. They are exceptionally affectionate and friendly companion birds when properly trained and cared for.</p>
